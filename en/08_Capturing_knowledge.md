# Capturing knowledge at meet ups
One important function of the developer meet ups is the sharing of knowledge and learning between SilverStripe practitioners. To expand the reach of this globally we try to where possible video the meetups and make them available to the community to learn from too.

The equipment you might use to capture videos at meetups as a meetup coordinator might vary however here are some simple tips to help ensure you can capture the best possible video and ensure that our valuable community knowledge is sharable.

## Tips on capturing good video at live events
(Adapted from [‘Tips for Shooting Live Events by Julia Campbell’](http://juliacampbell.net/?p=269)).
### Always ensure your camera is on a tripod
If you don’t have access to a tripod, use a table or other flat surface. Hand held cameras tend to be shaky and although there are stabilisers available, they tend to take a long time and the results are still not as good as if you have still footage to start with.

### Check your framing
As you only have one shot at capturing the talk, set the frame a little wider than you expect you would use in the final edit to give subjects some room to move. The extra room means that if they do move they won’t step out of frame and if they don’t you can scale down the frame in your editing software.

### 	Clean up
Remove any excess cables from your area if you are able. Make sure you remove any excess furniture, rubbish or other mess from the space you are filming. These things cannot be removed in editing and will make your video look amateur.

### Check your microphone placement
Speakers tend to not only move but fidget. This noise will be picked up by sensitive microphones. Make sure your microphone is placed somewhere that they cannot reach it with their hands and still close enough that it can pick up audio. If you have a mic that is not attached to your camera make sure you think about where you are going to place it. It is important to check the audio in headphones before you start, ensuring that you can hear the subject. If you have a lapel mic, make sure you leave enough time in-between speakers to switch it over.

### 	Turn off Autofocus!
If you are not using a professional grade camera it is important to check that autofocus is off. Most consumer grade cameras naturally revert to autofocus, so you don’t have to focus the image yourself. If the subject moves the image will keep trying to focus itself meaning it will go in and out of focus. This cannot be fixed in editing software so it is important to be sure that autofocus is off and that you set an appropriate focus point. There is generally a section in the settings in which to turn the camera to manual focus.

## Editing
* Make sure to trim and fade in the beginning and end of videos.
* Add a SilverStripe intro video to the start of meetup videos. There are two to choose from: [Popup](http://www.silverstripe.org/assets/Community-Resources/SilverStripe-Brand-Intro-Popup.mp4) and [Zoom In](http://www.silverstripe.org/assets/Community-Resources/SilverStripe-Brand-Intro-Zoomin.mp4).
* Add a title screen after the intro video

### Editing software
There are many options for software to edit your video after the meetup. Both Windows and Mac have bundled video editors such as iMovie or Windows movie maker.

There are also some useful open source video editing applications:
* [Lightworks](http://www.lwks.com/)
* [Kdenlive](https://kdenlive.org/)

You may also look at commercial packages such as Adobe Premiere or Final Cut Pro (though these might be expensive!).

### Rendering
Render your finished movie out at at least 720p resolution and using MP4 H.264 compression.

## Uploading to the SilverStripe Vimeo
To upload your meetup video contact the [SilverStripe Community Manager](mailto:community@silverstirpe.org) and they will arrange an temporary FTP login you can simply dropbox your video to. Also provide a title and description including any links to slides in the email.
