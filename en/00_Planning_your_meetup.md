#Planning

* Try to plan as far ahead as possible and stick to your schedule. 
* Make sure, you have some flexible time built into your schedule. For example, if someone is giving a talk, 
* expect it’s going to add at least 20 minutes of Q&A, calculate it in your program.
* The more spare time you have, the better. 
* Be aware, a conference is not about “having talks”, it’s about people interaction. Give your visitors the time to talk with each other and with speakers.

Be prepared for anything. Like “Ow crap, no coffee” or “Wow, this talk is interesting, I don’t want to cut it now, so I’ll have to cut upcoming talks short”. Make sure you have all those scenarios played out and know what to do.
