title: Using Meetup.com

#Using Meetup.com (online event management tool)

##General pointers
Keep your members up to date and communicate with them. 
Keep them informed with every step you take. 
Even if the step means “We’re on a break”. 
Not saying anything is the worst thing to do.

##Setting up Meetup.com for you local group
TODO

##On the day of the event
* Print attendee list - Go to your Meetup event page, under tools there is a "Print attendee list". Print out a copy to have handy for security or the venue to tick off names before letting people in.
* Print name tags - Go to your Meetup event page, under tools select "Print name tags". Select the settings you prefer and then "Create name tags", a PDF will be generated and downloaded which you can then print onto Avery name tag labels #8395, #5395, #45395, or any 2x8 A4 labels if you set the page print scale to 110%. Or, you can use regular paper and cut out the name tags to insert them into plastic holders.
