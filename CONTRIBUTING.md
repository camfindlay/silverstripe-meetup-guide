## Writing style guide
*	Use simple language and words. Avoid uncommon jargon and overly long words.
*	Use UK English and not US English. SilverStripe is proudly a New Zealand open source project we use the UK spelling and forms of English. The most common of these differences are -ize vs -ise, or -or vs our (eg color vs colour).
*	We use sentence case for titles so only capitalise the first letter of the first word of a title. Only exceptions to this are when using branded (e.g. SilverStripe), acronyms (e.g. PHP) and class names (e.g. ModelAdmin).
*	Use gender neutral language throughout the document, unless referencing a specific person. Use them, they, their, instead of he and she, his or her.
*	URLs: is the end of your sentence is a URL, you don't need to use a full stop.
*	Bullet points: Sentence case your bullet points, if it is a full sentence then end with a full stop. If it is a short point or list full stops are not required.
*	Write in second plural form: Use "we" instead of "I". It gives the text an instructive and collaborative style.
*	It's okay to address the reader.
*	Write in an active and direct voice.
*	"SilverStripe" should always appear without a space, use two capital Sâ€™.
